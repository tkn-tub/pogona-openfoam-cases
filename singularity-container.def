    # "scheme-basic"), then choose the option to just save the profile to `texlive.profile`.

%help
    This container can be used for running OpenFOAM fluid simulations for the Pogona macroscopic molecular communication simulator.

    Open a shell for example like so: `./cases.simg /bin/bash`.

    To run a simulation, call this container with "cd /mamoko-openfoam-cases/<case dir> && ./AllRun"
